A concept-driven portfolio website designed for a **.NET Developer** and **Digital Marketing Executive**. 

This project moves away from standard corporate templates, instead using a **"Digital Court"** theme that reflects my passion for Basketball, Art, and Technology. It treats code like a sport: structured, fast, and strategic.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Dual-Identity Hero:** Immediately establishes expertise in both Backend Development and Marketing Strategy.
* **Thematic UI:** A "Dark Mode" interface with basketball court geometry, energetic orange accents, and artistic brush-stroke reveals.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No heavy frameworks or build steps required.
* **Performance Animations:**
    * **Scroll Reveals:** Uses the `IntersectionObserver` API for smooth element fade-ins.
    * **Fusion Zone:** An accordion-style interest section that expands on hover.
    * **Physics Hovers:** Buttons and icons react with "dribble" and rotation effects.
* **Fully Responsive:** optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🛠️ Customization

To make this your own, look for the following sections in `index.html`:

* **Contact Info:** Update the `mailto:` and `tel:` links in the footer section.
* **Colors:** You can change the entire theme by modifying the CSS Variables at the top of the `<style>` block:
    ```css
    :root {
        --accent-bball: #ff5e00; /* Change for primary accent */
        --accent-art: #00f2ff;   /* Change for secondary accent */
    }
    ```
